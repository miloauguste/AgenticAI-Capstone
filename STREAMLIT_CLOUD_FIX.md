# 🔧 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix

## Issue: Missing CrewAI Dependencies

### Error Message:
```
File "/mount/src/agenticai-capstone/ui_app.py", line 23, in <module>
    from multi_agent_system import FeedbackAnalysisSystem
File "/mount/src/agenticai-capstone/multi_agent_system.py", line 18, in <module>
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
```

### Root Cause:
The `requirements.txt` file was missing several key dependencies required by the multi-agent system.

### ✅ Solution Applied:

#### Updated `requirements.txt`:
```txt
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
plotly>=5.15.0
openai>=1.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
requests>=2.31.0
crewai>=0.22.0
langchain-community>=0.0.20
langchain-google-genai>=0.0.6
```

#### Missing Dependencies Added:
1. **`crewai>=0.22.0`** - Core CrewAI framework for multi-agent systems
2. **`langchain-community>=0.0.20`** - LangChain community components (ChatOpenAI, etc.)
3. **`langchain-google-genai>=0.0.6`** - Google Gemini integration for LangChain

### 🚀 Deployment Steps:

1. **Update your GitHub repository** with the fixed `requirements.txt`
2. **Push changes to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Fix: Add missing CrewAI and LangChain dependencies"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Streamlit Cloud will auto-redeploy** with the new dependencies
4. **Wait for deployment** to complete (may take 3-5 minutes)
5. **Test the application** to ensure it loads without errors

### 🔍 Verification:

After deployment, the application should:
- ✅ Load without import errors
- ✅ Display the main dashboard
- ✅ Allow file uploads and processing
- ✅ Generate tickets successfully

### ⚠️ Potential Additional Issues:

If you encounter further errors, check for:

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Streamlit secrets
   - Optionally set `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Google Gemini support

2. **Memory Limitations**:
   - CrewAI + LangChain can be memory-intensive
   - Community Cloud has 1GB RAM limit
   - Consider optimizing agent initialization

3. **Version Compatibility**:
   - CrewAI and LangChain versions may need adjustment
   - If issues persist, try pinning to specific versions

### 🎯 Quick Test Commands:

To test locally before pushing:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run ui_app.py
```

### 📞 Support:

If the deployment still fails after this fix:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installing correctly
3. Consider simplifying the agent system for cloud deployment

**Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy with fixed dependencies
